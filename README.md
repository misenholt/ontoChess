chess ontology for LIS590RO

This commit includes the python files I am using to import and work with the data, the ontology file, the test data files I am using for development, and the outputs from the python programs. 

The descriptive ontology is mostly complete; the only major thing to do there is work out the move parsing. Much of the work in that area will be able to be reused in analytical onology.
